tedcosm is a simple Erlang application for obtaining current power consumption from a TED5000 
device and uploading it to cosm.com.  

To use tedcosm you will obviously need a TED5000 and an account on cosm.com.  After that create a 
file, tedcosm.hrl, with the following information:

-define(COSM_API_KEY, _YOUR_COSM_API_KEY_).
-define(COSM_URL, "http://api.cosm.com/v2/feeds/_YOUR_FEED_ID_/datastreams/_DATASTREAM_/datapoints.json").
-define(TED_URL, "http://_YOUR_TED_IP_/api/LiveData.xml").
-define(DEBUG, 0).
-define(UPLOAD_RATE, 3000).

In erl, you can then c(tedcosm). and tedcosm:start().  Over time I'll be adding the ability to 
daemonize and run.
